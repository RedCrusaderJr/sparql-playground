* 
*   9 Geometry Topology Extension (relation_family, serialization, version)
*
*   This clause establishes the Geometry Topology Extension (relation_family, serialization, version) 
*   parameterized requirements class, with URI /req/geometry-topology-extension, which defines a collection
*   of topological query functions that operate on geometry literals. This class is parameterized to give 
*   implementations flexibility in the topological relation families and geometry serializations that they 
*   choose to support. This requirements class has a single corresponding conformance class Geometry Topology
*   Extension (relation_family, serialization, version), with URI /conf/geometry-topology-extension.
*
*   The Dimensionally Extended Nine Intersection Model (DE-9IM) has been used to define the relation tested by 
*   the query functions introduced in this section. Each query function is associated with a defining 
*   DE-9IM intersection pattern. Possible pattern values are -1 (empty), 0, 1, 2, T (true) = {0, 1, 2},
*   F (false) = {-1}, * (donâ€™t care) = {-1, 0, 1, 2}. In the following descriptions, the notation X/Y is used
*   denote applying a spatial relation to geometry types X and Y (i.e., x relation y where x is of type X and
*   y is of type Y). The symbol P is used for 0-dimensional geometries (e.g. points). The symbol L is used for
*   1-dimensional geometries (e.g. lines), and the symbol A is used for 2-dimensional geometries (e.g. polygons).
*   Consult the Simple Features specification [ISO 19125-1] for a more detailed description of DE-9IM 
*   intersection patterns.
*
*   9.3 Requirements for Simple Features Relation Family (relation_family=Simple Features)
*   
*   This clause establishes requirements for the Simple Features relation family.
*   
*   Req 22 Implementations shall support geof:sfEquals, geof:sfDisjoint, geof:sfIntersects, geof:sfTouches, 
*   geof:sfCrosses, geof:sfWithin, geof:sfContains, geof:sfOverlaps as SPARQL extension functions, consistent 
*   with their corresponding DE-9IM intersection patterns, as defined by Simple Features [ISO 19125-1].
*   /req/geometry-topology-extension/sf-query-functions
*
*   Boolean query functions defined for the Simple Features relation family, along with their associated 
*   DE-9IM intersection patterns, are shown in Table 5 below. Multi-row intersection patterns should be
*   interpreted as a logical OR of each row. Each function accepts two arguments (geom1 and geom2) of the
*   geometry literal serialization type specified by serialization and version. Each function returns an 
*   xsd:boolean value of true if the specified relation exists between geom1 and geom2 and returns false
*   otherwise. In each case, the spatial reference system of geom1 is used for spatial calculations.
*
*   geof:sfIntersects(geom1: ogc:geomLiteral, geom2: ogc:geomLiteral): xsd:boolean
*   
*   DE-9IM Intersection Pattern: (T******** *T******* ***T***** ****T****)
